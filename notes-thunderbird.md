Moving profile
--------------

    http://kb.mozillazine.org/Moving_your_profile_folder_-_Thunderbird

Starting from CLI allows more options, see:

    thunderbird --help

After copying the profile from another computer, start with the profile manager
and select the desired profile, after which normal starts will use it:

    thunderbird --ProfileManager

### Problem

I copied a profile from 4k resolution computer to a 2k one, now icons and text
are huge. How to scale it back down? Don't see anything relevant-looking in the
settings...
