##### columns settings #####
##
## syntax of song columns list format is "column column etc."
##
## - syntax for each column is:
##
## (width of the column)[color of the column]{displayed tag}
##
## Note: Width is by default in %, if you want a column to have fixed size, add
## 'f' after the value, e.g. (10)[white]{a} will be the column that take 10% of
## screen (so the real width will depend on actual screen size), whereas
## (10f)[white]{a} will take 10 terminal cells, no matter how wide the screen
## is.
##
## - color is optional (if you want the default one, leave the field empty).
##
## Note: You can give a column additional attributes by putting appropriate
## character after displayed tag character. Available attributes are:
##
## - r - column will be right aligned
## - E - if tag is empty, empty tag marker won't be displayed
##
## You can also:
##
## - give a column custom name by putting it after attributes, separated with
##   character ':', e.g. {lr:Length} gives you right aligned column of lengths
##   named "Length".
##
## - define sequence of tags, that have to be displayed in case predecessor is
##   empty in a way similar to the one in classic song format, i.e. using '|'
##   character, e.g. {a|c|p:Owner} creates column named "Owner" that tries to
##   display artist tag and then composer and performer if previous ones are not
##   available.
